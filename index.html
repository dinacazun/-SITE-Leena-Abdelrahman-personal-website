        <p>Description: "Our application is an image to text converter, and basic handwriting recognition software that allows users to easily convert an image with text on it into quickly searchable text. Additionally, we have included a basic digit conversion, in order to help users decipher difficult digits. While there are other applications that do similar things to our program, the quick and efficient use of ours puts it above others, as well as including digit conversion with bounding boxes to allow for lower resolution or harder to read fonts to be recognized."</p>
